Instructions to play:

Use arrow keys to move cursor and hold down the spacebar while pressing arrow keys to move tiles. 

```bash
rake run #To run the server
rake compile #To compress the javascript into one file
rake watch #To watch your javascript files and compress as you edit
```

I did not use a framework for JS testing.  To run tests uncomment ```RunTests``` line in ```index.html``` and ```"tests"``` in ```config.json```
